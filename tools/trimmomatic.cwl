      Remove low quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a

      Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality
      within the window falls below a threshold. By considering multiple
      bases, a single poor quality base will not cause the removal of high

      Removes bases regardless of quality from the end of the read, so that the
      read has maximally the specified length after this step has been
      performed. Steps performed after CROP might of course further shorten the
      read. The value is the number of bases to keep, from the start of the read.

    doc: >
      Remove low quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value
      below this threshold the base is removed and the next base (which as
      trimmomatic is starting from the 3 prime end would be base preceding
      the just removed base) will be investigated. This approach can be used
      removing the special Illumina "low quality segment" regions (which are
      marked with quality score of 2), but we recommend Sliding Window or
      MaxInfo instead

  maxinfo:

      Performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining
      longer reads against the costs of retaining bases with errors.
      <targetLength>: This specifies the read length which is likely to allow
      the location of the read within the target sequence to be determined.
      <strictness>: This value, which should be set between 0 and 1, specifies
      the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs.
      removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (<0.2) favours
      longer reads, while a high value (>0.8) favours read correctness.

doc: >
  Trimmomatic is a fast, multithreaded command line tool that can be used to trim and crop
  Illumina (FASTQ) data as well as to remove adapters. These adapters can pose a real problem
  depending on the library preparation and downstream application.
  There are two major modes of the program: Paired end mode and Single end mode. The
  paired end mode will maintain correspondence of read pairs and also use the additional
  information contained in paired reads to better find adapter or PCR primer fragments
  introduced by the library preparation process.
  Trimmomatic works with FASTQ files (using phred + 33 or phred + 64 quality scores,
  depending on the Illumina pipeline used).
